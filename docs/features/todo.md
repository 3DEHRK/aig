TODO â€” Items left out of feature docs

This file lists remaining gaps and non-critical items not fully specified in individual feature docs.

Global:
- Exact JSON schema for saves including versioning and migration steps.
- Networked multiplayer design (out of scope but note for future).
- Localization pipeline and string storage.

WaterSim:
- Detailed API for in-game pump control UI.
- Edge-case: connected components when map changes frequently.

PowerSim:
- Backup generator scheduling UI.

Farming:
- Crossbreeding and mutation algorithm specifics.
- Pest/disease progression model and treatment items.

Rails:
- Curved track art and physics.
- Detailed cart AI for obstacle avoidance.

Entities:
- NPC social graph influence propagation rules.

UI:
- Controller mapping layout for consoles.

Tools / Implementation:
- Unit test harness and CI scripts.
- Placeholder art generator for rapid prototyping.

If you'd like, I can expand any of the TODO items into full specs or start implementing core prototypes (WaterSim, PowerSim, Tile/Asset importer).
